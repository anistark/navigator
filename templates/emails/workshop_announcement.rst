Greeting Pythonistas,

Many of you have been asking for details of workshops this year.

The CFP team has been tirelessly working on choosing best possible
workshops out there, focusing more on quality than on quantity,ensuring
more advance tracks.

We will be having just { x } workshops at each track this year.
With a total of { y } workshops on the workshop day of { date }.
Each workshop will be hands-on sessions of 3 hours.

This year, CFP committee had a tough job, selecting the workshops that hopefully would
appeal to everyone while trying to maintain quality.

We would like to thank everyone who took time off from their busy schedules and
helped review the talks and interact with the proposers. You are a tough little group;
we appreciate all the hard work you folks have put in. Thanks a ton, PyCon India
would not be the same was it not for all of you. A big shout out to the community for
being such a great support.

 We would also like to congratulate all those who made it through the selection process.

 Best of luck!

There will be three halls for the workshops; held in two sessions of morning
and afternoon.
