Dear { name },

Many of us, including both participants & volunteers, had a memorable time at
PyCon India this year. From learning new things to making new friends and
connections, there were times at which we wished those 3 days would never come
to an end. Well, maybe you didn't wish as much, but definitely the kids at the
Child Care did. ;)

In any case, here are a few things to remember those days by, to catch up on the
moments you missed out on and to keep in touch. We should definitely have
healthy discussions over the coming year to see how we can further improve the
conference, both in terms of sessions & in terms of being inclusive.

 - A few photos streams - { stream-links }

 - The session videos are up! We're quite pleased to see that the recordings
   have come out with decent quality this year. Checkout the { YouTube playlist }.

- If you would like to be notified of important updates and dates regarding the
  conference, please sign up on our { announcement mailing list }.

 - If you want to be a part of all the discussions and volunteer to take up
   responsibilities, sign up on our { Inpycon discussion mailing list }.

 - Here is our { Facebook } page as well as our { Twitter } feed. Like, follow.

 - Just in case some of you missed out on filling up the feedback forms, here is
   an { online Feedback form } to let us know what you felt about the sessions.

I guess that would be all for the time being. If you have any feedback that you
would like to share, even if it is just to say that you had a great time (yep,
we love those kind of comments!), please send them over on the Inpycon
discussion mailing list, Twitter or Facebook, all of which I have linked to
above. It'll either help us to improve ourselves or will help to keep us
motivated.

Until next time then.

Warmly,

The PyCon India Team.
