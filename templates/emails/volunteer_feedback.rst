Hi

First of all big Thank You for making PyCon India a great event. Success of the
event solely due to volunteers like you. Hope you got the most required break.

In order to make the event better next year, we would like to hear from you and
your team about the volunteer experience and possible improvements. It can be
about your team task or/and other tasks you observed before and during the
event. If you haven't filled the volunteer feedback form [0], please spend a
minute. As you may know it is anonymous form, please be open to express your
views. Also, pass on the form to other volunteers in your team.

This will help next year PyCon India Team to improve. Once again, Thank you for
your efforts!
