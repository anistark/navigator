.extend()
=========

PyCon India 2020 received an overwhelming number of good talks, but the review panel
could pick a selected number of them.

Inspired from Cloud Native Rejekts, the team thought of PyCon India thought of
bringing `.extend()`. A b-side track during the conference with the rejected talks.

in Hopin, and Ical.
